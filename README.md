# ear-training "game"

## Instructions

Make and activate a venv and use `pip install -r requirements.txt`
Run `python tone.py` to generate some wav files with which to quiz yourself

Each file contains a random series of two slightly different tones.
Listen to one (without looking at the full file name), and try to jot down
the ups & downs of the tones, e.g. 1000110110. Check against the filename.

You can adjust the number of tones, the tuning width, etc in `tone.py`.
